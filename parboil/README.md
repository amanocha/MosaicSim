# Parboil Benchmarks Status:

[x] bfs -> DONE, could also use ASPLOS version

[x] cutcp -> DONE

[x] histo -> DONE

[o] lbm -> kernelized, incorrect parallelism, might need to downsize (mem trace is 2.8GB), difficult

[x] mri-gridding -> DONE

[x] mri-q -> DONE

[x] sad -> DONE

[x] sgemm -> DONE

[x] spmv -> DONE

[x] stencil -> DONE

[?] tpacf -> DONE, but parallelism and kernel should be checked
